	Abstract = {ObjectiveWe investigated the relationship between social support and health service use among men and women with depression. MethodsParticipants were 1379 adults with symptoms of depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 score ≥5) in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Using the framework of the Andersen Behavioral Model of Health Services Use, multivariable regression models used social support, stratified by depression severity, to estimate association with utilization of mental health and nonmental health services. Partial F-tests examined a priori interactions between social support and gender. ResultsAmong those with adequate social support, odds of seeing a nonmental health provider were much higher when depression was moderate [Odds Ratio (OR): 2.6 (1.3--5.3)] or severe [OR: 3.2 (1.2--8.7)], compared to those lacking social support. Conversely, odds of mental health service use were 60% lower among those with moderate depression [OR: 0.4 (0.2--1.0)] when social support was adequate as opposed to inadequate. Social support was unrelated to service use when depression was mild. Gender moderated the relationship between social support and health service use among individuals with severe depression. ConclusionsSocial support has opposite associations with mental and nonmental health service use among adults with clinically significant depression. This association is largely attributable to the effect of male gender on the relationship between social support and health service use.},

	Abstract = {The identification of a mental disorder at its early stages is a challenging task because it requires clinical interventions that may not be feasible in many cases. Social media such as online communities and blog posts have shown some promising features to help detect and characterise mental disorder at an early stage. In this work, we make use of user-generated content to identify depression and further characterise its degree of severity. We used the user-generated post contents and its associated mood tag to understand and differentiate the linguistic style and sentiments of the user content. We applied machine learning and statistical analysis methods to discriminate the depressive posts and communities from non-depressive ones. The depression degree of a depressed post is identified using variations of valence values based on the mood tag. The proposed methodology achieved 90%, 95% and 92% accuracy for the classification of depressive posts, depressive communities and depression degree, respectively.},

	Abstract = {<bold>Background: </bold>The aim of this study was to explore the association of social support received, and functional and psychological status of colorectal cancer patients before surgery with changes in health-related quality of life (HRQoL) outcomes measured by EORTC QLQ-C30 at 1-year post-intervention.<bold>Methods: </bold>Consecutive patients that were because of undergo therapeutic surgery for the first time for colon or rectum cancer in nine hospitals in Spain were eligible for the study. Patients completed questionnaires before surgery and 12 months afterwards: one HRQoL instrument, the EORTC QLQ-C30; a social network and social support questionnaire, the Duke-UNC Functional Social Support Questionnaire; the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, to assess anxiety and depression; and the Barthel Index, to assess functional status; as well as questions about sociodemographic information. General linear models were built to explore the association of social support, functional status, and psychological variables with changes in HRQoL 12 months after intervention.<bold>Results: </bold>A total of 972 patients with colorectal cancer took part in the study. Patients' functional status, social support, and anxiety and depression were associated with changes in at least one HRQoL domain. The higher functional status, and the higher social support, the more they improved in HRQoL domains. Regarding anxiety and depression, the more anxiety and depression patients have at baseline, less they improve in HRQoL domains.<bold>Conclusions: </bold>Patients with colorectal cancer who have more social support and no psychological distress may have better results in HRQoL domains at 1 year after surgery.

Thus, a large number of techniques have been developed based on Artificial Intelligence (Logic-based techniques, Perceptron-based techniques) and Statistics (Bayesian Networks, Instance-based techniques). The goal of supervised learning is to build a concise model of the distribution of class labels in terms of predictor features. The resulting classifier is then used to assign class labels to the testing instances where the values of the predictor features are known, but the value of the class label is unknown. This paper describes various classification algorithms and the recent attempt for improving classification accuracy---ensembles of classifiers.},

@article{Kroenke,
	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: While considerable attention has focused on improving the detection of depression, assessment of severity is also important in guiding treatment decisions. Therefore, we examined the validity of a brief, new measure of depression severity. MEASUREMENTS: The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) is a self-administered version of the PRIME-MD diagnostic instrument for common mental disorders. The PHQ-9 is the depression module, which scores each of the 9 DSM-IV criteria as "0" (not at all) to "3" (nearly every day). The PHQ-9 was completed by 6,000 patients in 8 primary care clinics and 7 obstetrics-gynecology clinics. Construct validity was assessed using the 20-item Short-Form General Health Survey, self-reported sick days and clinic visits, and symptom-related difficulty. Criterion validity was assessed against an independent structured mental health professional (MHP) interview in a sample of 580 patients. RESULTS: As PHQ-9 depression severity increased, there was a substantial decrease in functional status on all 6 SF-20 subscales. Also, symptom-related difficulty, sick days, and health care utilization increased. Using the MHP reinterview as the criterion standard, a PHQ-9 score > or =10 had a sensitivity of 88% and a specificity of 88% for major depression. PHQ-9 scores of 5, 10, 15, and 20 represented mild, moderate, moderately severe, and severe depression, respectively. Results were similar in the primary care and obstetrics-gynecology samples. CONCLUSION: In addition to making criteria-based diagnoses of depressive disorders, the PHQ-9 is also a reliable and valid measure of depression severity. These characteristics plus its brevity make the PHQ-9 a useful clinical and research tool.},

Our Class Distribution Estimation-Ensemble (CDE-EM) methods estimate class distribution from many models instead of one resulting in less bias than previous method. All methods are evaluated using accuracy on set of benchmark UCI data sets. Experimental results demonstrate that our methods yield better performance if class distribution of test data is different from train data.},

	Abstract = {For class imbalance problem, the integration of sampling and ensemble methods has shown great success among various methods. Nevertheless, as the representatives of sampling methods, undersampling and oversampling cannot outperform each other. That is, undersampling fits some data sets while oversampling fits some other. Besides, the sampling rate also significantly influences the performance of a classifier, while existing methods usually adopt full sampling rate to produce balanced training set. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm that utilizes a new hybrid scheme of undersampling and oversampling with sampling rate selection to preprocess the data in each ensemble iteration. Bagging is adopted as the ensemble framework because the sampling rate selection can benefit from the Out-Of-Bag estimate in bagging. The proposed method features both of undersampling and oversampling, and the specifically selected sampling rate for each data set. The experiments are conducted on 26 data sets from the UCI data repository, in which the proposed method in comparison with the existing counterparts is evaluated by three evaluation metrics. Experiments show that, combined with bagging, the proposed hybrid sampling method significantly outperforms the other state-of-the-art bagging-based methods for class imbalance problem. Meanwhile, the superiority of sampling rate selection is also demonstrated. {\copyright} Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.},

	Abstract = {BackgroundBlood folate concentrations have been linked to an increased risk of depression in adults. Depression is particularly pronounced among women; however, the association between folate concentration and depression is not well-examined among women of reproductive age. The purpose of our study was to assess the association between low serum and red blood cell folate concentration and the risk of moderate to severe depression among non-pregnant women of reproductive age in the United States (U.S.). MethodsWe used data from nationally representative, population-based U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) (2011--2012) examining non-pregnant women of reproductive age (20--44 years). We compared serum and red blood cell (RBC) folate concentrations between women with and without self-reported depression based on Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) scores, and examined the association between folate concentrations and depression using linear and logistic regression analysis. ResultsA total of 16.7% of eligible women in our study reported to have moderate to severe depression. The median serum folate concentrations for women with and without depression were 17.8ng/ml and 17.2ng/ml, respectively (P = <0.01). There was no statistical difference in median RBC folate concentrations between women with and without depression (P = 0.2). Serum folate concentration was weakly associated with an increased risk of moderate to severe depression among non-pregnant women of reproductive age, after adjusting for important demographic and life-style factors (aOR: 1.11; 95% CI: 1.01, 1.22). There was no interaction with race and ethnicity. LimitationsCross-sectional design. ConclusionsFolate concentrations in the blood may partly explain the increased risk of moderate to severe depression among non-pregnant women of reproductive age in the U.S. Robust prospective studies are needed to confirm our findings. *About 17% of participants were categorized to have moderate to severe depression.*Serum and red blood cell folate concentration was positively associated with depression.*There was no effect-modification in the main association due to race and ethnicity.},

	Abstract = {Little is known about the manifestation of teenage depression on Social Network Sites (SNS) in general, and in adolescents' Facebook status updates in particular. ObjectiveIn this study, we compare the traditional `offline' clinical picture of depression with its online manifestations and explore unique features of online depression that are less dominant `offline'. MethodWe collected 190 Facebook status updates of adolescents-at-risk (14--18 yrs), who receive psychosocial treatment. Ten licensed psychologists rated the extent to which a status update contained references to depression (α = 0.96). ResultsBased on both theory-driven as well as bottom-up approaches, a coding scheme was developed, resulting in a total of 13 features that significantly differentiated between `depressive status updates' and `non-depressive status updates'. Detailed descriptions and examples of these features are offered. Furthermore, a multiple regression analysis revealed four status update features that predicted status update depression scores: (1) DSM-5 depressive symptoms (including emotional and behavioral, but not somatic symptoms); (2) cognitive distortions; (3) poetic-dramatic form of verbal content; and (4) attitudes toward others. ConclusionsWe discuss the findings and highlight unique features of online depression manifestation, which will ultimately contribute to early (and perhaps even automatic) detection of adolescents' depression from their online SNS activities. *Manifestations of adolescents' depression on Social Network Sites (SNS) are described.*Depression was rated by mental health experts in 190 Facebook status updates of adolescents.*13 features differentiated depressive from non-depressive status updates.*Top-down significant predictors of depression were: DSM-5 symptoms and cognitive distortions.*Bottom-up predictors of depression were poetic-dramatic style and attitudes toward others.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To provide estimates of change in depressive symptoms and determine how changes in depressive symptom influence recovery of functional status. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Eleven inpatient medical rehabilitation facilities located across the United States. PARTICIPANTS: Five hundred forty-four persons with a first-time stroke. MEASUREMENTS: General linear regression model estimates assessed associations between depressive symptom change and functional status 3 and 12 months after discharge. RESULTS: The majority of persons with stroke were aged 75 and older, white, female, and married. The most prevalent stroke type was ischemic. For participants without depression at discharge, those who reported fewer depressive symptoms 12 months after stroke than before had an adjusted functional status score of 108.2, whereas those with more symptoms had an adjusted functional status score of 104.6. For participants who were depressed at discharge, those who reported fewer depressive symptoms 12 months after stroke than before had an adjusted functional status score of 100.3, whereas those with more symptoms had an adjusted functional status score of 88.0. CONCLUSION: Tracking depressive symptom change in the hospital and after discharge is clinically relevant and is an important component of patient care and recovery of functional status.},

Statistical features were computationally extracted from 43,950 participant Instagram photos, using color analysis, metadata components, and algorithmic face detection. Resulting models outperformed general practitioners' average unassisted diagnostic success rate for depression. These results held even when the analysis was restricted to posts made before depressed individuals were first diagnosed. Human ratings of photo attributes (happy, sad, etc.) were weaker predictors of depression, and were uncorrelated with computationally-generated features. These results suggest new avenues for early screening and detection of mental illness.},

We examined the discriminant validity of the Inventory to Diagnose Depression, lifetime version (IDDL), that is, a self‐report instrument designed to diagnose a lifetime history of major depressive disorder. Remitted patients with major depression (MD), remitted patients with anxiety disorders (ADS) and controls completed the IDDL. The IDDL results were then compared in the three contrasts: MD vs. ADs + controls, MD vs. ADS, and MD vs. controls. The agreement between the IDDL and clinical diagnoses was high in each of the three contrasts, and the IDDL total score in the MD group was the highest among the three groups and distinguished from the ADS group or controls. However, the IDDL occasionally diagnosed subjects with a lifetime history of ADS as having a lifetime history of MD.},

	Abstract = {ObjectiveSerum cholesterol was reported to be associated with depressed mood, but the studies conducted among household population are rare. MethodsWe used the data of 4115 men and 4275 women aged 18 or older, who completed a depression screening interview and had blood collected as a part of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 2005--2008. The serum concentrations of total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) were gender-specifically categorized into lower, intermediate, and upper quartiles. Depression was measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire, a 9-item screening instrument asking about the frequency of depression symptoms over the past 2weeks. ResultsAfter adjustment for socio-demographics and behavioral risks, a U-shaped association was detected between severe depression and LDL-C among men. The odds ratios (ORs) of severe depression were 5.13 (95% CI=1.74--15.09), 1 (reference) and 2.28 (1.07--4.86) respectively for the men with lower (<169mg/dL), intermediate (169--221mg/dL), and upper quartile (≥222mg/dL) LDL-C. Among women, lower HDL-C was significantly associated with an elevated odds of severe depression [OR=2.96 (1.59--5.52)] compared with upper quartile of HDL-C, the association diminished after adjustment for covariates [OR=1.24 (0.66--2.32)]. No clear pattern of association between cholesterol and moderate depression was observed from either men or women. LimitationThe inherent limitation of cross-sectional design prevented the authors from investigating causality. ConclusionsA U-shaped association was identified between LDL-C and severe depression among men. Further studies are necessary to explore the biological mechanism and identify the clinical implication among populations vulnerable to psychiatric disorders.},

Waist-hip ratio (WHR) was used as an indicator of adiposity. MDE was assessed with the Diagnostic Interview Schedule. For normal-WHR women, the prevalence of MDE was reversely associated with leptin levels, 13.7(4.4)%, 12.2(4.0)% and 2.3(1.8)% respectively for lower, interquartile, and upper quartile. For abnormal-WHR women, the prevalence of MDE was positively associated with leptin, 6.1(2.3)%, 9.1(2.4)% and 20.0 (3.8) respectively for the three leptin levels. Compared to women with lower quartile of leptin, the odds ratio of MDE for women with upper quartile was 0.09 (0.01--0.98) for normal-WHR women but 4.35 (1.55--12.2) for abnormal-WHR women. No moderating effects were observed among men. Using BMI in place of WHR revealed similar findings. The association between MDE and leptin is moderated by adiposity. High leptin levels are associated with low odds of MDE among women with normal adiposity but high odds among women with abnormal adiposity. *The association between depression and leptin is moderated by adiposity among women.*Leptin deficiency associates with increased odds of depression among women with normal adiposity.*Leptin resistance associates with elevated odds of depression among women with abnormal adiposity.*Functionality rather circulating level of leptin is of clinical implications for depression development among women.*No moderating effects were observed among men.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mental illness is quickly becoming one of the most prevalent public health problems worldwide. Social network platforms, where users can express their emotions, feelings, and thoughts, are a valuable source of data for researching mental health, and techniques based on machine learning are increasingly used for this purpose. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this review was to explore the scope and limits of cutting-edge techniques that researchers are using for predictive analytics in mental health and to review associated issues, such as ethical concerns, in this area of research. METHODS: We performed a systematic literature review in March 2017, using keywords to search articles on data mining of social network data in the context of common mental health disorders, published between 2010 and March 8, 2017 in medical and computer science journals. RESULTS: The initial search returned a total of 5386 articles. Following a careful analysis of the titles, abstracts, and main texts, we selected 48 articles for review. We coded the articles according to key characteristics, techniques used for data collection, data preprocessing, feature extraction, feature selection, model construction, and model verification. The most common analytical method was text analysis, with several studies using different flavors of image analysis and social interaction graph analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Despite an increasing number of studies investigating mental health issues using social network data, some common problems persist. Assembling large, high-quality datasets of social media users with mental disorder is problematic, not only due to biases associated with the collection methods, but also with regard to managing consent and selecting appropriate analytics techniques.},
